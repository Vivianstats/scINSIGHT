 + Version 0.1.0 released!

 
## Introduction

scINSIGHT uses a novel matrix factorization model to jointly analyze multiple single-cell gene expression samples from biologically heterogeneous sources, such as different diseasephases,  treatment groups,  or developmental stages.   It assumes that each gene pathway is asparse  and  non-negative  linear  combination  of  genes,  and  each  cell  is  jointly  defined  by  theexpression of common and condition-specific pathways.   Given multiple gene expression sam-ples from different biological conditions, scINSIGHT aims to simultaneously identify common andcondition-specific gene pathways and quantify their expression levels in each sample in a lower-dimensional space .

Any suggestions on the package are welcome! For technical problems, please report to [Issues](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scINSIGHT/issues). For suggestions and comments on the method, please contact Kun (<kun_qian@foxmail.com>) or Vivian (<vivian.li@rutgers.edu>). 

## Installation

You can install `MAAPER` from CRAN with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("scINSIGHT")
```

## Usage
Please refer to the package tutorial for examples about how to use the package functions.
