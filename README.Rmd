 + Version 0.1.4 released!

 
## Introduction

scINSIGHT uses a novel matrix factorization model to jointly analyze multiple single-cell gene expression samples from biologically heterogeneous sources, such as different disease phases, treatment groups, or developmental stages. It assumes that each gene module is a sparse and non-negative linear combination of genes, and each cell is jointly defined by the expression of common and condition-specific modules.  Given multiple gene expression samples from different biological conditions, scINSIGHT aims to simultaneously identify common and condition-specific gene modules and quantify their expression levels in each sample in a lower-dimensional space.

Any suggestions on the package are welcome! For technical problems, please report to [Issues](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scINSIGHT/issues). For suggestions and comments on the method, please contact Kun (<kun_qian@foxmail.com>) or Vivian (<vivian.li@rutgers.edu>). 

## Installation

You can install `scINSIGHT` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scINSIGHT/index.html) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("scINSIGHT")
```

## Usage
Please refer to the [package vignette](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scINSIGHT/wiki/scINSIGHT-vignette) for examples about how to use the package functions.
